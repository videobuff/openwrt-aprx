# openwrt-aprx
This is the repository for the latest aprx, as maintained by PhirePhly.
It has been tested on Openwrt Lede 17.0.4 on 30-3-2018 but is not working yet. Work in progress
March 2018 - PA0ESH.
Today, 26th of december 2020, i will try another time to make this package work. If so, i will propose it
to be contained in the main stream openwrt. I do need some help from outsiders.
